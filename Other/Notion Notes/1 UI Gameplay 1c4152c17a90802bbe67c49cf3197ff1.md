# 1. UI / Gameplay

### User Interface

- A single building facade with clickable apartments and other elements of the facade
- Each apartment is a separate puzzle/story segment.
- No Built-In Journal: The site does not store or display your discovered clues or gathered information. You must remember details or record them externally.
- Ambient Discovery: No big tutorial or explanatory text. Users must explore, interpret clues, and piece together the broader setting on their own.
- [Audio](3%20Audio%201c4152c17a90800a8c70d799bffce372.md) controls will be embedded in the Building e.g. as contents of a billboard standing on the roof
    - A song name can also be displayed on the billboard

### Story Progression

- Each user will have their story saved under a [magic link](6%20Technical%20Implementation%201c4152c17a9080fa86a7da3ea5b5ef0a.md)
- Initially, only one apartment is available.
- Additional apartments will be added later (when developed)
    - they can be available from the game start or may need to be unlocked by game progress

### Time-flow

- what happens in the building will change depending on when the site is opened
- inhabitants will do different things at different times, but generally at night (Neon hints night, Dreams hints night)
- some clues can be solved only at certain times
