# 4. Puzzle Mechanics

- Clue Scattering: Cryptic notes, hints, and environmental storytelling are scattered throughout each apartment.
- The game features puzzles of varying difficulty. While players don't need to solve every puzzle to progress, tackling the more challenging ones leads to more rewarding outcomes.
- Some puzzles are mandatory for story progression; others grant bonus lore or Easter eggs.
- Certain clues can only be solved at specific times (when the website is opened).
- Some puzzles have details generated based on individual [magic link](6%20Technical%20Implementation%201c4152c17a9080fa86a7da3ea5b5ef0a.md), preventing players from easily sharing solutions with each other.

### AI

- Later in the game, players would be able to communicate with an LLM-powered system. Players would not know they are interacting with an LLM rather than scripted responses.
- All player inputs would be automatically filtered to prevent LLM exploitation.
