## Overview and Scope

### Concept

Concept: A single-page, [puzzle-based](4%20Puzzle%20Mechanics%201c4152c17a908070aafee18a37826658.md) website set in a nostalgic, pixel-art cyberpunk world. Each apartment within a looming dystopian building holds its own story, characters, and hidden clues. The site features AI-generated [techno music loops](3%20Audio%201c4152c17a90800a8c70d799bffce372.md) to enhance the atmosphere. As users solve puzzles, they unlock new apartments and gradually reveal the overarching narrative.

Objective: Neon Dreams aims to deliver an enigmatic, retro-cyberpunk puzzle experience that rewards curiosity, attention to detail, and persistence. By relying on the user’s own note-taking and discovery, the project fosters a sense of mystery and immersion, letting each visitor gradually unravel the connected “neon dreams” within the apartment building.
